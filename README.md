# Sampling from pre-trained diffusion model
This section provides a ready-to-run Google Colab notebook for sampling from pre-trained guided-diffusion models. It enables easy sampling from models trained on datasets such as FFHQ, CelebA-HQ, AFHQ, and CUB, without the need to manually download the checkpoints.
