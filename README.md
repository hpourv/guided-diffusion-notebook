# Sampling from pre-trained diffusion model
This section provides a ready-to-run Google Colab notebook for sampling from pre-trained guided-diffusion models. It enables easy sampling from models trained on datasets such as FFHQ, CelebA-HQ, AFHQ, and CUB, without the need to manually download the checkpoints.

# Image restoration with pre-trained diffusion model
Over the past few years, a wide range of diffusion-based methods for image restoration have been proposed. In this section, I present my own implementations of these approaches, based on the descriptions provided in the original papers rather than on their official GitHub implementations.(This section will be progressively completed.)
