# guided-diffusion

This is the codebase for [Diffusion Models Beat GANS on Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05233).

This repository is based on [openai/improved-diffusion](https://github.com/openai/improved-diffusion), with modifications for classifier conditioning and architecture improvements.

# Sampling from pre-trained diffusion model
This section provides a ready-to-run Google Colab notebook for sampling from pre-trained guided-diffusion models. It enables easy sampling from models trained on datasets such as FFHQ, CelebA-HQ, AFHQ, and CUB, without the need to manually download the checkpoints.
